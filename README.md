# FamilyTreeApi Welcome Page
I'm going to re-start this project, focusing more on the algorithmic side of things. 
  ## Frist things first: 
  I'll clean up the entity package with a new conceptional design + create dto classes that will interact with our services and apis. I made the mistake off desiging my system based on the database model, it should be based on the business rules, and the persistence layer shouldn't be in the core of the application.
